Human: Im thinking about making a repo for vibe coding that is template for ai agent that developer can start with 

Idea as sketch:
1. Documentation-Driven Development (DDD)
- instructions.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- TODO.md
- ci/cd instructions.md
/Features/
- <date>_feature_<feature_name>.md
- <date>_feature_<feature_name>.md

2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Use Testing freamworks that supports "Behavior-Driven Development"-syntax like ex
 Pest, Jest, Behave, Cucumber-JVM, RSpec, SpecFlow, Ginkgo, Quick

----

Those files shouldn't be in the project files it should be live in /.ai 
 But generated tests should be the language/freamwork it self 

Also why not use copilotinstaructuons file or agents.md 
ChatGPT: Good idea — it’s like an AI-native starter kit where a repo teaches itself how to evolve. Here’s how you can shape it:

🔹 Concept: “Vibe Coding”
A repo pattern that merges Documentation-Driven, Behavior-Driven, and AI-Driven development.
Developers describe intent, AI writes the code and tests, humans review.

🧱 Repo Structure (/.ai)
bashCopy code/.ai/
  ├── instructions.md        # project philosophy, repo rules, coding conventions
  ├── ARCHITECTURE.md        # system design, components, data flow
  ├── TODO.md                # prioritized task list or backlog
  ├── copilot_instructions.md# (optional) prompt hints for GitHub Copilot / LLM
  ├── agents.md              # defines roles, goals, and context for AI agents
  ├── ci_cd_instructions.md  # how AI or CI should run builds/tests/deploys
  └── features/
        ├── 2025-11-01_feature_auth-system.md
        └── 2025-11-01_feature_ai-chatbot.md

Goal: the .ai folder is the source of truth for intent; the rest of the repo is the manifestation of that intent.

🔹 AI Pipeline


Read /ai/features/*.md
→ Each file defines behavior (“When user does X, system does Y”).


Generate Tests (language-native, e.g. Pest for PHP, Jest for JS).


Generate Code to satisfy tests.


Run CI/CD to validate; commit automatically if all green.


You can even have an agent like /.ai/agents/test-writer.md that defines how to translate BDD specs into framework syntax.

🔹 Integration Hooks


.github/workflows/ai.yml → runs “generate tests → validate → commit”.


Copilot Instructions → tuned prompts for the local IDE AI assistant.


agents.md → can define named roles (Architect, Coder, Reviewer) and instructions, enabling chain-of-thought-like structured collaboration.



🔹 Bonus


Add /.ai/history/ to store conversations or diffs between agent iterations.


Add metadata header to feature docs:
yamlCopy codefeature: user-authentication
owner: backend
priority: high
depends_on: database-schema



Eventually, this becomes a meta-repo template anyone can fork to bootstrap an AI-driven dev loop.



Would you want me to draft the actual /.ai folder scaffold (with example content for instructions.md, agents.md, and one feature file)?
Human: Im thinking that its not repo, it will be like a command line that after 
"npx start-vibe" will install all files inside a current repo code 
ChatGPT: Perfect — now you’re thinking like a framework author, not just a template builder.
You’re essentially creating a CLI bootstrapper for AI-driven repos.
Here’s how to structure it:

🔹 Project Name
vibe (or create-vibe for npm clarity)
Goal: inject AI-ready development scaffolding into any existing repo.

🔹 Core Behavior
bashCopy codenpx start-vibe

Does the following:


Creates a /.ai directory with starter docs (instructions, architecture, etc.).


Adds .github/workflows/vibe.yml for AI/TDD automation.


Optionally creates tests/ folder with framework-agnostic BDD test stubs.


Adds or updates .gitignore, .vibeconfig.json, etc.


Offers to install BDD test dependencies for the detected language.


Optionally initializes a CopilotInstructions.md or agents.md.



🔹 Detection Layer
The CLI detects the environment:
jsCopy codelanguage: php | js | python | java | ruby | go | swift
framework: laravel | express | django | spring | rails | ...

Based on this, it picks correct testing framework:
LanguageDefault BDD FrameworkPHPPestJS/TSJestPythonBehaveJavaCucumber-JVMRubyRSpecC#SpecFlowGoGinkgoSwiftQuick

🔹 Internal Layout (installed into target repo)
bashCopy code/.ai/
  ├── instructions.md
  ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
  ├── TODO.md
  ├── agents.md
  ├── copilot_instructions.md
  ├── ci_cd_instructions.md
  └── features/example_feature_login.md
/.github/workflows/vibe.yml
.vibeconfig.json


🔹 .vibeconfig.json
Defines behavior and mapping between BDD docs → test framework:
jsonCopy code{
  "language": "php",
  "framework": "laravel",
  "testFramework": "pest",
  "aiIntegration": true,
  "generateOnPush": true
}


🔹 AI Agent Flow (Optional Future Step)
If aiIntegration=true,
vibe runs a background process or GitHub Action that:


Reads /ai/features/*.md


Generates framework-native tests


Suggests implementation diffs via PR or commit



🔹 Implementation Notes


Build CLI in Node.js (ESM)


Use commander for command parsing


Use prompts or inquirer for interactive setup


Ship templates as templates/ai/* copied using fs-extra


Publish as npx start-vibe (short alias for npx @vibe-cli/init)



Want me to draft the CLI architecture and first executable script layout (like /bin/start-vibe.js, /templates/ai/, config merging logic, etc.) next?
Human: I’m planning to how to create a **CLI bootstrapper for AI-driven repos**.
Here’s how to structure it:

---

### 🔹 Project Name

**`vibe`** (or `create-vibe` for npm clarity)
Goal: inject AI-ready markdown templates into *any existing repo*.

---

### 🔹 Core Behaviorbash
npx start-vibe
Does the following:

1. Creates a `/.ai` directory with starter docs (instructions, architecture, etc.).
2. Adds `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,`agents.md` with basic AI usage tips, and instructions to read `/.ai/`.
---



### 🔹 Internal Layout (installed into target repo)
/.ai/
  ├── instructions.md
  ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
  ├── TODO.md
  ├── agents.md
  ├── copilot_instructions.md
  ├── ci_cd_instructions.md
  └── features/example_feature_login.md
.github/copilot-instructions.md
agents.md


create a prompit for codex to create this npm tool
ChatGPT: txtCopy codeYou are Codex, an expert Node.js developer.  
Create an npm CLI package called `vibe` (published to run as `npx start-vibe`) — a **CLI bootstrapper for AI-driven repos**.  

### 🎯 Goal
When a user runs:
```bash
npx start-vibe

the tool installs AI-related markdown templates into their current project.

🧱 Requirements


Language & Structure


Node.js (ESM preferred)


Entry point: /bin/start-vibe.js with a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env node)


Use commander for CLI parsing


Use fs-extra for file operations


Use path and url for resolving template paths




Behavior


Detect current working directory.


Copy the predefined templates folder structure into it.


Create folders if not exist.


Skip overwriting existing files unless user passes --force.




Installable Structure
